# Prompt

Design an algorithm to find the weighted average of four test scores.

# Description

Using object oriented programming principals. Set methods to allow access to instance variables outside class. Declares a class, and creates an object of that class. 

#Pseudocode

Class test_scores_average_algorithm {   // No constructor defined - uses default constructor
   Declarations
      private int test_score_1            // Instance variables declared as private - encapsulation
      private int test_score_2
      private int test_score_3
      private int test_score_4
      private int average_of_test_scores

   public void set_test_scores(ts1, ts2, ts3, ts4)   // Set method declared as public to allow access to other classes
      test_score_1 = ts1
      test_score_2 = ts2
      test_score_3 = ts3
      test_score_4 = ts4
      return 

   private void calc_average()
      average_of_test_scores = (test_score_1 + test_score_2 + test_score_3 + test_score_4) / 4

   public void print_average()
      calc_average ()                        //calc_average() called to ensure always prints correct value
      output average_of_test_scores
