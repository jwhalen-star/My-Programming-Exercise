# My Programming Journey

Welcome to the "My Programming Journey" repository.
Within this repository you will find structured pseudocode representations, flowcharts, and of course, actual code I have written in various programming languages to address various programming oriented exercises.
Within these various implementations, I explore fundamental coding and syntax and concepts. 
Furthermore, each implementation is designed to showcase a deep and fulfilled understanding of the strategies being applied, as well as clearly documents the learning process embedded within this repository. 
All code is custom written, and each coding challenge is inspired by classic programming exercises, which have been uniquely reimagined and presented here.
