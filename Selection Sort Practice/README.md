Welcome to my selection sort folder.
A selection sort is a type of sorting algorithm that compares the current element in a list to the rest of the elements in a list, and swaps them if a smaller/larger value is found, depending on the purpose of the sort.
As the list is sorted, the sorted portion of the list to the left gradually grows. 
As the sorted portion on the left grows larger, the portion yet to be sorted on the right becomes smaller, until the entire list is sorted.
